    <h3>Traveling &amp; Accommodations</h3>
    <p>
      If you are traveling to the wedding or would just like to spend the night in San Francisco we have reserved a block of rooms
      at the <a href="http://www.westinstfrancis.com" title="the hotel">Westin St. Francis Hotel</a> on Union Square.  You can book a
      room at a discounted rate if you use <a href="#" title="click here to get your room cheaper">this link</a> or let them know
      that you are part of the Morton-Crawford wedding when you call.
    </p>
    <h3>About the weather</h3>
    <p>
      While it is August the weather can be a bit unpredictable.  It could be warm summer night or if the fog rolls in it could be a chilly 50&deg;.
      The best advice is be prepared and bring an extra layer.
