  <div class="body">
    <p>
      We are having the ceremony and reception at the 
      <a href="http://www.sfnpc.org/sterngrovepinelakehistory" title="Trocadero clubhouse history">Trocadero Clubhouse</a> in 
      <a href="http://www.sfmuseum.org/hist/stern.html" title="Sigmund Stern Grove">Sigmund Stern Grove</a>.  
      The clubhouse is nestled in the woods in the South East most corner of the park, on the corner of 19th Avenue and Sloat Boulevard.  
      The entrance to Stern Grove is located on Sloat Boulevard.  There is very limited parking at the clubhouse itself.  
      Some street parking is available on Sloat but it is a long walk down a steep hill and we encourage everyone to take advantage of the shuttle 
      that we will be providing from the Westin St. Francis hotel.
