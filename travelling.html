    <h3>Airports</h3>
    <p>
      There are two airports convenient to San Francisco.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="http://www.flysfo.com/web/page/index.jsp" title="San Francisco International">San Francisco International (SFO)</a>
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="http://www.flyoakland.com/index3.cfm" title="Oakland International">Oakland International (OAK)</a>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      It's easy to get into San Francisco from either airport, but it's best to avoid taking a taxi since it's a long expensive ride.
      An airport shuttle is your best bet or you can take the <a href="http://www.bart.gov/">BART</a> train to Powell Street.  There is a 
      BART station in the San Francisco airport. At the Oakland airport there is a shuttle bus that goes to the Oakland Coliseum station, where you
      can catch the BART train for Powell St. The fare is $5.35 one way from SFO or $3.55 from Oakland.
